# Required.
# Sets the name of the package. This will be used in along with `pkg_origin`,
# and `pkg_version` to define the fully-qualified package name, which determines
# where the package is installed to on disk, how it is referred to in package
# metadata, and so on.
pkg_name=passenger

# Required unless overridden by the `HAB_ORIGIN` environment variable.
# The origin is used to denote a particular upstream of a package.

# Required.
# Sets the version of the package.

# Optional.
# The name and email address of the package maintainer.

# An array of valid software licenses that relate to this package.
# Please choose a license from http://spdx.org/licenses/
# pkg_license=('Apache-2.0')

# Required.
# A URL that specifies where to download the source from. Any valid wget url
# will work. Typically, the relative path for the URL is partially constructed
# from the pkg_name and pkg_version values; however, this convention is not
# required.
pkg_source="http://s3.amazonaws.com/phusion-passenger/releases/passenger-${pkg_version}.tar.gz"

# pkg_name and pkg_version values.
# pkg_filename="${pkg_name}-${pkg_version}.tar.gz"

# Required if a valid URL is provided for pkg_source or unless do_verify() is overridden.
# The value for pkg_shasum is a sha-256 sum of the downloaded pkg_source. If you
# do not have the checksum, you can easily generate it by downloading the source
# and using the sha256sum or gsha256sum tools. Also, if you do not have
# do_verify() overridden, and you do not have the correct sha-256 sum, then the
# expected value will be shown in the build output of your package.
